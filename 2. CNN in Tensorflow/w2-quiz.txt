1. Question 1
How do you use Image Augmentation in TensorFLow


With the tf.augment API


With the keras.augment API


- Using parameters to the ImageDataGenerator


You have to write a plugin to extend tf.layers

Question 21
point
2. Question 2
If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?


Use the ‘flip_vertical’ parameter around the Y axis


Use the ‘flip’ parameter and set ‘horizontal’


- Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter


Use the ‘flip’ parameter

Question 31
point
3. Question 3
When training with augmentation, you noticed that the training is a little slower. Why?


- Because the image processing takes cycles


Because there is more data to train on


Because the training is making more mistakes


Because the augmented data is bigger

Question 41
point
4. Question 4
What does the fill_mode parameter do?


There is no fill_mode parameter


It creates random noise in the image


- It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear


It masks the background of an image

Question 51
point
5. Question 5
When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.


It gets overwritten, so be sure to make a backup


A copy is made and the augmentation is done on the copy


- Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory


It gets deleted

Question 61
point
6. Question 6
How does Image Augmentation help solve overfitting?


It slows down the training process


- It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images


It manipulates the validation set to generate more scenarios for features in the images


It automatically fits features to images by finding them through image processing techniques

8. Question 8
Using Image Augmentation effectively simulates having a larger data set for training.


False


- True
