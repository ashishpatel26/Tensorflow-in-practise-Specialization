2. Question 2
Why does the DNN for Fashion MNIST have 10 output neurons?


To make it train 10x faster


To make it classify 10x faster


Purely Arbitrary


- The dataset has 10 classes

What is a Convolution?


A technique to make images smaller


A technique to make images larger


- A technique to extract features from an image


A technique to remove unwanted images

4. Question 4
Applying Convolutions on top of a DNN will have what impact on training?


It will be slower


It will be faster


There will be no impact


- It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!

6. Question 6
When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.


A copy will be made, and the copies are augmented


A copy will be made, and the originals will be augmented


- Nothing


The images will be edited on disk, so be sure to have a backup

7. Question 7
Can you use Image augmentation with Transfer Learning?


No - because the layers are frozen so they can't be augmented


- Yes. It's pre-trained layers that are frozen. So you can augment your images as you train the bottom layers of the DNN with them
